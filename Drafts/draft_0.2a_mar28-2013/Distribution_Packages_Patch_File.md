Distribution Packages Patch file (``packages.yml?since=...``)
=============================================================

This file can be generated by a script sorting out only the updated packages
since a specific date and only transfer those to the client. This is more
efficient than downloading the full contents every time something changes in
general.

Note: ``packages.yml.gz?since=...`` is a GZIP-compressed copy or mirror of this
    file.

The contents and the typical plain content are equal to those of the complete
Distribution Packages file, though the file will only contain packages updated
since the specified date.

In case the server doesn't support the since parameter and therefore can't serve
updates as patches, the client will just use a fallback and compare all cached
entries with those which the server sends (which is every package with every
metadata as it accesses the full ``packages.yml``).

Parameters:
- "since":
	Specifies the date until when packages should be seen as "old" and should
	not be transferred anymore. The date should be ideally formatted after ISO
	8601 or - if the repository server/script supports it - some shorter variant
	of it.

Recommendation: Generate this file dynamically when needed (by request) or in
				a periodic time interval (by cron) from the available Package
				Metadata files.
